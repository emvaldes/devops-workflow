Description:
    This file serves as the execution entry point for the `requirements` package when run
    in standalone mode. It initializes and runs the dependency management system by calling
    the `main()` function from `dependencies.py`.

Core Features:
    - **Standalone Execution**:
      - Enables `python -m packages.requirements` execution.
      - Allows the package to be run independently without direct imports.
    - **Dependency Management**:
      - Calls `main()` from `dependencies.py` to handle package installations.
      - Applies structured package policies for controlled dependency enforcement.
    - **Modular Design**:
      - Supports both standalone execution and direct function imports.

Usage:
    To execute the `requirements` package as a standalone script:

        python -m packages.requirements

    Example execution:

        python -m packages.requirements

Dependencies:
    - dependencies.py (Handles package dependency management)

Expected Behavior:
    - When run as a module, it triggers dependency management automatically.
    - Ensures dependencies are installed or updated based on predefined policies.
    - Logs all package operations for debugging and compliance tracking.

Exit Codes:
    - 0: Execution completed successfully.
    - 1: Failure due to dependency issues, missing configurations, or package errors.
