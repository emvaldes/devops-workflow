Description:
    The dependencies.py module is the core of the AppFlow Tracer - Dependency Management System,
    providing structured and policy-driven package management. It integrates Homebrew (macOS)
    and Pip (cross-platform) to ensure compliance with package versioning,
    safe installations, and structured logging.

Core Features:
    - Environment Detection: Determines Python installation method (Homebrew, system-managed, or standalone).
    - Package Management: Handles installation, upgrades, downgrades, and policy enforcement.
    - Brew & Pip Integration:
        - Uses Homebrew if Python is managed via Brew.
        - Uses Pip for all other installations with controlled system package handling.
    - Policy-Based Installation:
        - Installs missing dependencies.
        - Upgrades outdated packages if policy allows.
        - Downgrades packages if strict versioning is required.
    - Logging & Debugging:
        - Captures package operations, warnings, and errors.
        - Provides structured debugging messages.
    - Backup & Restore:
        - Saves the current package list for future restoration.
        - Supports migration of package environments.
    - Package Status Reporting:
        - Displays installed dependencies, versions, and compliance details.
        - Outputs structured reports to installed.json.

Usage:
    Parsing Command-Line Arguments:
        from packages.requirements.dependencies import parse_arguments
        args = parse_arguments()

    Installing Dependencies:
        from packages.requirements.dependencies import main
        main()

Dependencies:
    - sys - Manages system paths and process control.
    - subprocess - Runs Homebrew and Pip commands.
    - json - Handles structured storage of dependency data.
    - pathlib - Ensures safe file path handling.
    - functools - Optimizes frequently accessed functions with caching.
    - argparse - Parses command-line arguments.
    - platform - Detects system platform details.
    - importlib.metadata - Retrieves installed package versions.
    - brew_utils, package_utils, policy_utils, version_utils - Sub-modules managing dependency operations.

Sub-Modules:
    - brew_utils.py: Detects Homebrew availability and retrieves package versions.
    - package_utils.py: Handles dependency installation using Brew or Pip.
    - policy_utils.py: Enforces policy-driven installation, upgrades, and downgrades.
    - version_utils.py: Fetches installed and latest package versions across multiple package managers.

Expected Behavior:
    - Dynamically adapts package installation based on system constraints.
    - Installs, upgrades, or downgrades dependencies per predefined policies.
    - Logs all package operations for debugging.
    - Prevents unintended system modifications unless explicitly overridden (--force).

Exit Codes:
    - 0: Execution completed successfully.
    - 1: Failure due to installation errors, missing configurations, or dependency issues.

    Function: parse_arguments() -> argparse.Namespace
    Description:
        Parses command-line arguments for package management, allowing users to define requirement files, enforce installations,
        backup, restore, or migrate packages.

    Returns:
        - argparse.Namespace: Parsed arguments object containing selected options.

    Behavior:
        - Supports JSON configuration for package management.
        - Allows forcing installations with --force.
        - Supports backup, restore, and migration of package environments.
        - Enables listing installed packages.

    Supported Arguments:
        - -c/--config: Specify a custom JSON requirements file.
        - -f/--force: Force Pip installations with --break-system-packages.
        - --backup-packages: Save installed packages for restoration.
        - --restore-packages: Restore package environment from a backup file.
        - --migrate-packages: Migrate legacy package environments.
        - --show-installed: Display installed dependencies.

    Error Handling:
        - Provides structured logging for missing configurations or invalid input.
