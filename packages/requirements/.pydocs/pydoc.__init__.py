File Path: packages/requirements/__init__.py

Description:
    This file initializes the `requirements` package, ensuring it is correctly recognized
    as a Python package. It provides an entry point for dependency management by exposing
    the `main` function from `dependencies.py`.

Core Features:
    - **Package Initialization**:
      - Marks `requirements/` as a valid Python package.
      - Ensures explicit module control, preventing unintended imports.
    - **Dependency Management**:
      - Exposes `main()` from `dependencies.py` for managing package installations.
      - Facilitates structured and policy-driven dependency handling.

Usage:
    Importing and executing dependency management:

        from packages.requirements import main
        main()

    Example execution:
        python -m packages.requirements

Dependencies:
    - dependencies.py (Handles package dependency management)

Expected Behavior:
    - The package remains passive until explicitly invoked.
    - Calling `main()` triggers the dependency installation process.
    - No automatic execution occurs upon import.

Exit Codes:
    - 0: Execution completed successfully.
    - 1: Failure due to dependency issues, missing configurations, or package errors.

    Description:
        Entry point for the dependency management system.

    Parameters:
        - None

    Returns:
        - None: Executes dependency installation and policy enforcement.

    Behavior:
        - Reads and processes package requirements from `requirements.json`.
        - Installs, upgrades, or downgrades dependencies based on policies.
        - Logs package operations for debugging and compliance tracking.
