Description:
    AppFlow Tracing Package Entry Point

    This module acts as the execution entry point for the `appflow_tracer` package when invoked
    using `python -m packages.appflow_tracer`. It ensures structured logging and tracing
    are properly initialized by delegating execution to the `main()` function within the `tracing` module.

Core Features:
    - **Standalone Execution**: Enables the package to run independently via `python -m packages.appflow_tracer`.
    - **Automatic Logging Setup**: Ensures structured logging and tracing configurations are loaded.
    - **Main Function Invocation**: Calls the `main()` function from the `tracing` module to handle execution flow.

Usage:
    Running the `appflow_tracer` package as a standalone application:
        ```bash
        python -m packages.appflow_tracer
        ```

    This will:
    - Initialize structured logging.
    - Start function execution tracing.
    - Manage log file retention.

Dependencies:
    - `tracing` (Handles logging and execution flow management.)

Exit Codes:
    - `0`: Successful execution.
    - `1`: Failure due to configuration or tracing errors.

Example:
    Running the package from the command line:
        ```bash
        python -m packages.appflow_tracer
        ```

    This will invoke the `main()` function from the `tracing` module, ensuring correct execution.

    "main": """
    Executes the main tracing function for the `appflow_tracer` package.

    This function serves as the primary execution entry point when the package is run as a module.
    It initializes logging, sets up tracing, and ensures the framework operates as expected.

    Raises:
        Exception: If an error occurs during logging or tracing initialization.

    Returns:
        None

    Example:
        Running `appflow_tracer` as a standalone application:
            ```bash
            python -m packages.appflow_tracer
            ```
