Description:
    AppFlow Tracing System
    This module provides structured logging and function call tracing, enabling
    automatic function execution monitoring with minimal intrusion. It integrates
    logging and tracing functionalities, ensuring accurate tracking of function
    calls, return values, and execution flow.

Core Features:
    - **Function Call Tracing**: Automatically captures function calls, arguments, and return values.
    - **Structured Logging**: Logs execution details in JSON format for debugging and auditing.
    - **Self-Inspection**: When executed directly, logs its own execution for analysis.
    - **Automatic Log Management**: Removes old log files to maintain storage efficiency.
    - **Configurable Event Filtering**: Allows selective tracing of function calls and returns.
    - **Console and File Logging**: Captures print statements and ensures logs do not contain ANSI escape sequences.

Usage:
    To enable function call tracing:
        import tracing
        tracing.setup_logging()

    To run the tracing system as a standalone tool:
        python tracing.py

Dependencies:
    - `sys` - Provides system-level operations, including path management.
    - `json` - Enables structured logging in JSON format.
    - `inspect` - Used for function introspection and execution tracing.
    - `logging` - Handles structured logging and message formatting.
    - `builtins` - Overrides `print` statements for structured logging.
    - `pathlib.Path` - Resolves file and directory paths dynamically.
    - `datetime` - Used for timestamping and log file management.
    - `lib.system_variables` - Provides global project-wide configurations.
    - `lib.pkgconfig_loader` - Loads and manages logging and tracing configurations.
    - `lib.file_utils` - Handles log file cleanup and path resolution.
    - `lib.log_utils` - Provides structured logging utilities.
    - `lib.trace_utils` - Implements function call tracing and execution flow monitoring.

Global Variables:
    - `LOGGING` (bool): Flag indicating whether logging has been initialized.
    - `CONFIGS` (dict): Stores the effective logging and tracing configurations.
    - `logger` (logging.Logger): Global logger instance used for structured logging.

Primary Functions:
    - `setup_logging(configs, logname_override, events)`: Initializes structured logging.
    - `main()`: Entry point for standalone execution, setting up tracing and logging.
    - `PrintCapture.emit(record)`: Captures print statements and redirects them to logs.
    - `ANSIFileHandler.emit(record)`: Ensures log files do not contain ANSI escape sequences.

Expected Behavior:
    - Logs execution details when tracing is enabled.
    - Logs function calls with arguments and return values.
    - Maintains structured logs for debugging and execution tracking.
    - Automatically removes older log files when exceeding retention limits.

Exit Codes:
    - `0`: Successful execution.
    - `1`: Failure due to configuration or logging setup errors.

Example:
    Importing the tracing system and enabling structured logging:
        from tracing import setup_logging
        setup_logging()

class PrintCapture(logging.StreamHandler):

    Custom logging handler that captures print statements and logs them
    while ensuring they are displayed in the console.

    This ensures that print statements are properly logged without affecting
    real-time console output.

    def emit(self, record: logging.LogRecord) -> None:

        Custom logging handler that captures print statements and logs them
        while ensuring they are displayed in the console.

        This ensures that print statements are properly logged without affecting
        real-time console output.

        Args:
            record (logging.LogRecord): The log record that contains information
                about the log message to be captured and displayed.

        Returns:
            None

class ANSIFileHandler(logging.FileHandler):

    Custom FileHandler that removes ANSI codes from log output
    and filters out logs from the internal Python logging module.

    This prevents unnecessary ANSI escape codes from appearing in log files
    and ensures only relevant logs are recorded.

    def emit(self, record: logging.LogRecord) -> None:

        Custom FileHandler that removes ANSI codes from log output
        and filters out logs from the internal Python logging module.

        This prevents unnecessary ANSI escape codes from appearing in log files
        and ensures only relevant logs are recorded.

        Args:
            record (logging.LogRecord): The log record to be emitted, including
                log message and additional context for filtering.

        Returns:
            None

    Configures and initializes the global logging system.

    This function sets up the logging environment, creating log files and adding handlers
    for both file-based and console-based logging. It ensures proper logging behavior
    even when no configuration is provided.

    Args:
        configs (dict, optional): A dictionary containing logging configurations.
            If None, the default global configurations are used.
        logname_override (str, optional): A custom name for the log file.
            If None, the log file name is derived from the calling script.
        events (bool, list, or dict, optional):
            - `None` / `False` → Disables all event logging.
            - `True` → Enables all event logging.
            - `list` → Enables only specified events (e.g., ["call", "return"]).
            - `dict` → Enables/disables events per user settings (e.g., {"call": True, "return": False}).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the provided logging configurations are not in a dictionary format.

    Returns:
        dict: The effective logging configuration after applying defaults.

    Example:
        >>> setup_logging()
        {
            "logging": {
                "log_filename": "/path/to/logfile.log",
