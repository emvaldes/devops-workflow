Description:
    Standalone Testing Script for Framework Logging

    This script serves as a test module to verify logging and tracing capabilities.
    It initializes structured logging via `packages.appflow_tracer.tracing`,
    prints configuration details, and runs a simple test output.

Features:
    - Configures logging using `tracing.setup_logging()`.
    - Prints the loaded logging configuration in JSON format.
    - Serves as a standalone script that can be run independently.

Expected Behavior:
    - The script prints the structured logging configuration.
    - Demonstrates logging setup and verification for debugging purposes.
    - Can be used as a simple test script for logging functionality.

Dependencies:
    - `packages.appflow_tracer.tracing` (for structured logging)
    - `sys`, `json`, `logging`, `pathlib` (for system interaction and logging setup)

Usage:
    To execute the test:
        python scripts/testing.py

Exit Codes:
    - 0: Execution completed successfully.
    - 1: Failure due to logging setup errors or missing configurations.
