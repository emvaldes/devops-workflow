Description:
    Scripts Package Initialization

    This module ensures that the `scripts/` directory is recognized as a Python package.
    It provides a structured framework for organizing standalone scripts while maintaining
    explicit import control.

Core Features:
    - **Package Initialization**: Enables `scripts/` to function as a Python package.
    - **Modular Script Management**: Ensures standalone scripts can be structured and executed efficiently.
    - **Explicit Import Control**: Prevents unintended execution by requiring explicit script imports.
    - **Future Expansion**: Can be extended to initialize common utilities if needed.

Usage:
    Scripts within `scripts/` should be explicitly imported when needed:
        from scripts import some_script
        some_script.execute()

Important Notes:
    - This file **does not** automatically import submodules to prevent unnecessary execution.
    - Individual scripts must be explicitly imported as required to maintain modularity.

Dependencies:
    - None (This module is solely responsible for initialization)

Example:
    To execute a standalone script within `scripts/`:
        from scripts import example_script
        example_script.run()
