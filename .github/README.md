## Workflows Structure
The framework consists of multiple GitHub workflow files that interact to form a cohesive CI/CD pipeline. This modular approach enhances maintainability by allowing individual components to be updated independently and improves scalability by enabling the addition of new workflows without disrupting the existing structure. Each workflow performs a specialized function, contributing to the overall automation process. These workflows interact seamlessly to create an efficient pipeline by validating parameters, installing dependencies, executing tests, aggregating results, and deploying the final module. This structured approach ensures consistency and reliability at every stage of the CI/CD process. For example, the `module.validate-parameters.yaml` workflow ensures that input parameters are correctly formatted before execution, preventing errors and inconsistencies in subsequent jobs. Below is an in-depth look at the key workflows and their respective roles:

### 1. [Module Dependencies Workflow](.github/workflows/pkgs.module-dependencies.yaml)
This workflow handles the installation of package dependencies required for the tests and execution modules.

- **Triggers:**
  - Manually via `workflow_dispatch`
  - On `push` and `pull_request` events to specific branches (`master`, `functional`)
- **Jobs:**
  - **Workflow Validation:** Uses `module.validate-parameters.yaml` to validate the input parameters, ensuring correctness before execution.
  - **Install Packages:** Runs `module.install-packages.yaml` to install required dependencies from `requirements.json`.
  - **Execute PyTests:** Runs `pytest.module-matrix.yaml` to execute the test suite across different test cases and Python versions.
  - **Execute Module:** Runs `module.execute-module.yaml` to execute the module after successful test validation.

### 2. [Parameter Validation Workflow](.github/workflows/module.validate-parameters.yaml)
This workflow ensures that all parameters passed to different jobs within the framework are validated before execution.

- **Inputs:** JSON string containing workflow parameters.
- **Outputs:** A validated JSON object that is consumed by dependent workflows.
- **Implementation:**
  - Uses `validate-parameters.shell` to process and validate JSON input, reducing the risk of configuration errors.
  - Ensures all required fields are present and correctly formatted, preventing failures in later steps.
  - Outputs a structured JSON object to provide consistency across the CI/CD process.

### 3. [Package Installation Workflow](.github/workflows/module.install-packages.yaml)
Handles the installation of necessary dependencies across different Python versions, ensuring compatibility across various environments and preventing potential runtime issues when deploying applications in diverse production settings.

- **Implementation:**
  - Parses `requirements.json` to generate `requirements.txt`, ensuring dependencies are properly structured.
  - Uses GitHub Cache to optimize dependencies installation, reducing redundant downloads.
  - Installs dependencies for multiple Python versions (`3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`).
  - Stores and uploads the final `requirements.txt` to be used by subsequent workflows, preventing inconsistencies.

### 4. [PyTest Execution Workflow](.github/workflows/module.running-pytests.yaml)
This workflow manages the execution of PyTest functions across multiple Python versions, leveraging a matrix strategy for parallel test execution.

- **Strategy:**
  - Uses a matrix approach to run tests on different Python versions to identify compatibility issues early.
  - Runs individual test functions extracted from `pytest_functions.json`, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency by ensuring that only relevant test cases are executed. By dynamically selecting functions based on changes in the codebase, the framework minimizes unnecessary test runs, accelerates execution time, and ensures that only modified or affected areas of the code are retested, optimizing CI/CD performance.
  - Uploads test result artifacts (`pytest-results.xml`) for further aggregation and analysis. These artifacts are stored in the GitHub Actions workspace and uploaded as workflow artifacts, making them accessible for review, debugging, and integration with reporting tools.

### 5. [PyTest Extraction Workflow](.github/workflows/module.extract-pytests.yaml)
Extracts all test functions from the provided PyTest files for use in the test matrix.

- **Inputs:**
  - `pytest_files.json`: Contains the paths of PyTest test files.
  - `pytest_functions.json`: Maps extracted test functions to their respective modules.
- **Outputs:**
  - `pytest_files`: Extracted PyTest modules for execution.
  - `pytest_functions`: Extracted PyTest functions to be run individually.
- **Implementation:**
  - Uses `extract-pytest-functions.shell` to parse and extract test functions dynamically, ensuring up-to-date test coverage.

### 6. [PyTest Aggregation Workflow](.github/workflows/module.aggregate-results.yaml)
Aggregates test results from multiple PyTest runs into a unified report, providing a centralized test result output.

- **Implementation:**
  - Downloads all test artifacts generated by different test runs.
  - Runs `aggregate-pytest-results.shell` to consolidate test reports, ensuring structured output.
  - Outputs `aggregated_results=true` upon successful execution, which triggers subsequent workflows.
  - Ensures test logs and reports are available for debugging and verification. Developers can access these reports via the GitHub Actions workflow summary or by downloading the generated artifacts. Reports are typically available in JUnit XML and JSON formats, which can be analyzed using tools such as Allure, ReportPortal, or CI/CD dashboards for deeper insights into test performance and failure patterns.
Aggregates test results from multiple PyTest runs into a unified report, providing a centralized test result output.

### 7. [Module Execution Workflow](.github/workflows/module.execute-module.yaml)
Executes a Python module after the validation and testing phases have successfully completed.

- **Implementation:**
  - Uses validated parameters to determine which module to execute dynamically.
  - Runs the module as a Python package, ensuring proper namespace execution.
  - Ensures all dependencies are installed and environment variables are correctly set.
  - Outputs execution logs to track module performance and detect issues early.
  - This execution can be part of deployment, running the final module in a production-like environment, or an additional validation step to ensure functionality before release.

### 8. [Tracing Workflow](.github/workflows/pkgs.module-tracing.yaml)
Provides tracing and debugging capabilities for workflow execution.

- **Jobs:**
  - **Workflow Validation:** Ensures correct input parameters before execution.
  - **Install Packages:** Installs all required dependencies for tracing execution.
  - **Execute PyTests:** Runs PyTest suite with extended logging.
  - **Execute Module:** Executes the target Python module with tracing enabled to capture detailed runtime information.

- **Implementation:**
  - This tracing can help diagnose test failures by capturing logs at each step, making it easier to pinpoint issues such as incorrect environment configurations or unexpected test outputs.
  - Enables developers to track execution flow in real-time, ensuring that all dependencies and configurations are properly set before proceeding to the next stage.
