NAME
    lib.pkgconfig_loader - File Path: ./lib/pkgconfig_loader.py

DESCRIPTION
    Description:
        The pkgconfig_loader.py module provides utilities for dynamically loading, validating, and managing
        package configurations. It ensures structured configuration handling, logging setup, and package-specific
        settings retrieval.

    Core Features:
        - JSON Configuration Loading: Reads and validates structured configuration files.
        - Dynamic Logging Setup: Generates unique log file names and directories.
        - Configuration Overrides: Allows runtime overrides of configuration parameters.
        - Automatic Configuration Updates: Ensures settings are refreshed dynamically.
        - Error Handling: Captures and logs errors for missing or malformed configuration files.

    Usage:
        Loading Package Configurations:
            from lib.pkgconfig_loader import package_configs
            config = package_configs()

        Setting Up Configurations:
            from lib.pkgconfig_loader import setup_configs
            config = setup_configs(Path("/path/to/module"))

    Dependencies:
        - sys - Handles system path modifications and process exits.
        - os - Provides file system utilities.
        - json - Loads, modifies, and validates configuration data.
        - datetime - Handles timestamps for logging and configuration updates.
        - pathlib - Ensures safe file path resolution.
        - typing (Optional, Union) - Defines flexible function return types.

    Global Behavior:
        - Loads package configurations dynamically.
        - Generates structured logging paths.
        - Handles missing or invalid configuration files gracefully.
        - Updates timestamps when configurations change.

    CLI Integration:
        This module primarily supports configuration loading for other scripts but can be executed for testing.

    Example Execution:
        python pkgconfig_loader.py

    Expected Behavior:
        - Reads JSON-based configuration files.
        - Ensures logging directories and filenames are structured.
        - Handles missing configuration files with default fallbacks.

    Exit Codes:
        - 0: Execution completed successfully.
        - 1: Error encountered in configuration processing.

FUNCTIONS
    config_logfile(config: dict, caller_log_path: Optional[str] = None) -> pathlib._local.Path
        Function: config_logfile(config: dict, caller_log_path: Optional[str] = None) -> Path
        Description:
            Generates a structured log file path based on package settings.

        Parameters:
            - config (dict): Configuration dictionary containing logging details.
            - caller_log_path (Optional[str]): Custom log file path if specified.

        Returns:
            - Path: The computed log file path.

        Behavior:
            - Uses package name and timestamp to generate a unique log filename.
            - If a caller_log_path is provided, the log file is placed there.
            - Otherwise, the logs directory from the configuration is used.

    main() -> None
        Function: main() -> None
        Description:
            Placeholder function for module execution.

    package_configs(overrides: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict
        Function: package_configs(overrides: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict
        Description:
            Loads and returns package configuration settings, applying overrides if provided.

        Parameters:
            - overrides (Optional[dict]): Dictionary of settings to override.

        Returns:
            - dict: The structured configuration dictionary.

        Behavior:
            - Attempts to load a package-specific JSON configuration file.
            - If no file exists, generates a default configuration.
            - Merges any overrides provided by the caller.
            - Generates a log filename and updates timestamps dynamically.

        Error Handling:
            - Logs and exits if the JSON file is missing or malformed.

    setup_configs(
        absolute_path: pathlib._local.Path,
        logname_override: Optional[str] = None,
        events: Union[bool, list, dict, NoneType] = None
    ) -> dict
        Function: setup_configs(absolute_path: Path, logname_override: Optional[str] = None, events: Optional[Union[bool, list, dict]] = None) -> dict
        Description:
            Initializes and updates configuration settings based on the callerâ€™s package details.

        Parameters:
            - absolute_path (Path): Path to the module requiring configuration.
            - logname_override (Optional[str]): Allows overriding the default log filename.
            - events (Optional[Union[bool, list, dict]]): Specifies which logging events should be enabled.

        Returns:
            - dict: The final configuration dictionary.

        Behavior:
            - Identifies the calling module and determines package name.
            - Loads or generates the expected configuration file.
            - Adjusts logging settings, including log directory and filename.
            - Updates the configuration file dynamically with new settings.

        Error Handling:
            - Logs and exits if configuration updates fail.

DATA
    Optional = typing.Optional
        Optional[X] is equivalent to Union[X, None].

    Union = typing.Union
        Union type; Union[X, Y] means either X or Y.

        On Python 3.10 and higher, the | operator
        can also be used to denote unions;
        X | Y means the same thing to the type checker as Union[X, Y].

        To define a union, use e.g. Union[int, str]. Details:
        - The arguments must be types and there must be at least one.
        - None as an argument is a special case and is replaced by
          type(None).
        - Unions of unions are flattened, e.g.::

            assert Union[Union[int, str], float] == Union[int, str, float]

        - Unions of a single argument vanish, e.g.::

            assert Union[int] == int  # The constructor actually returns int

        - Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.::

            assert Union[int, str, int] == Union[int, str]

        - When comparing unions, the argument order is ignored, e.g.::

            assert Union[int, str] == Union[str, int]

        - You cannot subclass or instantiate a union.
        - You can use Optional[X] as a shorthand for Union[X, None].
