Help on module lib.pydoc_generator in lib:

NAME
    lib.pydoc_generator - File Path: ./lib/pydoc_generator.py

DESCRIPTION
    Description:
        The pydoc_generator.py module automates the generation of structured documentation for Python modules
        by leveraging Python's built-in pydoc utility. It also integrates test coverage analysis and logging.

    Core Features:
        - **Automatic Documentation Generation**: Uses pydoc to generate structured `.pydoc` files.
        - **Test Coverage Reporting**: Integrates with `coverage.py` to produce detailed reports.
        - **Dynamic File Structure Creation**: Ensures documentation files are stored systematically.
        - **Error Handling and Logging**: Provides structured logs for troubleshooting and debugging.
        - **Path Normalization**: Handles absolute and relative paths across various environments.

    Usage:
        Creating a PyDoc Structure:
            from lib.pydoc_generator import create_structure
            doc_dir = create_structure(Path("/docs"), "my_package")

        Generating Documentation for a Module:
            from lib.pydoc_generator import generate_pydoc
            generate_pydoc(Path("/project"), Path("/project/lib/my_module.py"), Path("/docs"))

    Dependencies:
        - sys - Handles system path modifications and process exits.
        - os - Provides file system utilities.
        - re - Regular expressions for text sanitization.
        - subprocess - Executes external commands (`pydoc`, `coverage`).
        - pathlib - Ensures safe and platform-independent file path resolution.
        - coverage - Generates code coverage reports.

    Global Behavior:
        - Generates documentation for Python modules.
        - Captures and logs errors encountered during the process.
        - Normalizes paths for consistent file system operations.
        - Applies automated test coverage validation.

    CLI Integration:
        This module primarily runs as part of an automated documentation pipeline but can be executed manually.

    Example Execution:
        python pydoc_generator.py

    Expected Behavior:
        - Successfully generates `.pydoc` documentation files.
        - Produces test coverage reports if coverage data is available.
        - Handles missing documentation files gracefully.
        - Logs all key actions and errors.

    Exit Codes:
        - 0: Execution completed successfully.
        - 1: Error encountered during documentation generation.

    ) -> pathlib._local.Path
        Function: create_structure(base_path: Path, package_name: Path) -> Path
        Description:
            Creates a directory structure for storing generated documentation files.

        Parameters:
            - base_path (Path): The root directory for documentation files.
            - package_name (Path): The subdirectory name for organizing files.

        Returns:
            - Path: The created directory path.

        Behavior:
            - Creates the specified directory if it does not already exist.
            - Ensures parent directories are also created.
