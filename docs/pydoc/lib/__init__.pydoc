Help on module lib.__init__ in lib:

NAME
    lib.__init__

DESCRIPTION
    Overview:
        The __init__.py file is responsible for marking the 'lib' directory as a Python package,
        allowing its modules to be imported properly within the project.

        This file serves as the entry point for the 'lib' package and may include shared imports,
        initialization logic, or package-wide configuration settings.

    Core Features:
        - Package Initialization: Ensures 'lib' is recognized as a Python package.
        - Shared Module Accessibility: Provides a central location for utility imports.
        - Extensibility: Can be modified to include package-wide configurations if necessary.

    Expected Behavior & Usage:
        Importing Modules from 'lib':
            from lib import system_variables, file_utils

    Example Integration:
        from lib import log_utils
            log_utils.log_message("Initialization successful.")

    Important Notes:
        - This file does not automatically import all submodules to prevent unnecessary overhead.
        - Individual submodules must be explicitly imported when required.
