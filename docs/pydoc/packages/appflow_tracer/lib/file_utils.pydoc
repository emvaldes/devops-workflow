NAME
    packages.appflow_tracer.lib.file_utils - # File: ./packages/appflow_tracer/lib/file_utils.py

FUNCTIONS
    is_project_file(filename: str) -> bool
        Determine if a given file path belongs to the project directory structure.

        This function verifies whether the specified `filename` is located within
        the project's root directory and is not an external dependency.

        Args:
            filename (str): The absolute or relative file path to be checked.

        Returns:
            bool: True if the file is within the project directory, False otherwise.

        Example:
            >>> is_project_file("appflow_tracer/tracing.py")
            True
            >>> is_project_file("/usr/lib/python3.8/external.py")
            False

        Notes:
            - If the filename is `None` or an empty string, the function returns `False`.
            - The function safely resolves the absolute path before performing the check.

    manage_logfiles(configs: dict = None) -> list
        Manage log file storage by removing old logs if the number exceeds a configured limit.

        This function prevents log directories from growing indefinitely by:
        - Checking the current number of log files in each log subdirectory.
        - Deleting the oldest logs **only if** the total count exceeds the allowed limit.

        Args:
            configs (dict, optional): Configuration dictionary that specifies:
                - `"max_logfiles"`: Maximum number of log files to retain.
                Defaults to `None`, in which case the global `max_logfiles` setting is used.

        Raises:
            OSError: If an error occurs while attempting to delete log files.

        Returns:
            list: A list of deleted log file paths.

        Workflow:
            1. Sorts log files by modification time (oldest first).
            2. Identifies files exceeding the limit.
            3. Deletes excess log files.
            4. Logs deletions using `log_utils.log_message()`.

        Notes:
            - The function ensures logging operations respect the `configs["logging"]["enable"]` flag.
            - If no logs exceed the threshold, no deletions occur, and an empty list is returned.

    relative_path(filepath: str) -> str
        Convert an absolute file path into a project-relative path.

        This function maps the given absolute path to the projectâ€™s directory structure.
        If the file is outside the project, it returns the original path as a fallback.
        The `.py` extension is removed from the resulting path for consistency.

        Args:
            filepath (str): The absolute file path to convert.

        Returns:
            str: The relative path within the project, or the original path if it
            cannot be converted.

        Example:
            >>> relative_path("/path/to/project/module.py")
            "module"

        Notes:
            - If the file is not within the project directory, the original path is returned.
            - The `.py` extension is removed for consistency in logging and output formatting.

    remove_ansi_escape_codes(text: str) -> str
        Remove ANSI escape sequences from a string.

        This function is used to clean up log messages or terminal output by
        stripping out escape codes that produce colored or formatted text.
        The resulting string contains only plain text.

        Args:
            text (str): The input string that may contain ANSI escape codes.

        Returns:
            str: A new string with all ANSI escape codes removed.

        Example:
            >>> remove_ansi_escape_codes("[31mThis is red text[0m")
            "This is red text"

        Notes:
            - ANSI escape codes are commonly used for terminal colorization.
            - The function ensures that formatted messages remain readable.
