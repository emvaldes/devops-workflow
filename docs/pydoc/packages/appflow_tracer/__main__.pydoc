NAME
    packages.appflow_tracer.__main__ - File Path: packages/appflow_tracer/__main__.py

DESCRIPTION
    Description:
        AppFlow Tracing Package Entry Point

        This module acts as the execution entry point for the `appflow_tracer` package when invoked
        using `python -m packages.appflow_tracer`. It ensures structured logging and tracing
        are properly initialized by delegating execution to the `main()` function within the `tracing` module.

    Core Features:
        - **Standalone Execution**: Enables the package to run independently via `python -m packages.appflow_tracer`.
        - **Automatic Logging Setup**: Ensures structured logging and tracing configurations are loaded.
        - **Main Function Invocation**: Calls the `main()` function from the `tracing` module to handle execution flow.

    Usage:
        Running the `appflow_tracer` package as a standalone application:
            ```bash
            python -m packages.appflow_tracer
            ```

        This will:
        - Initialize structured logging.
        - Start function execution tracing.
        - Manage log file retention.

    Dependencies:
        - `tracing` (Handles logging and execution flow management.)

    Exit Codes:
        - `0`: Successful execution.
        - `1`: Failure due to configuration or tracing errors.

    Example:
        Running the package from the command line:
            ```bash
            python -m packages.appflow_tracer
            ```

        This will invoke the `main()` function from the `tracing` module, ensuring correct execution.
