NAME
    packages.requirements.__init__ - File Path: packages/requirements/__init__.py

DESCRIPTION
    Description:
        Requirements Package Initialization

        This file defines the `requirements` package and ensures it is properly recognized
        as a Python package. It provides an entry point for managing dependencies by exposing
        the `main` function from `dependencies.py`.

    Core Features:
        - **Package Initialization**: Marks `requirements/` as a valid Python package.
        - **Dependency Management**: Exposes `main()` from `dependencies.py` for handling dependencies.
        - **Explicit Module Control**: Prevents unintended imports by requiring explicit calls.

    Usage:
        To execute the dependencies management function:
        ```python
        from packages.requirements import main
        main()
        ```

    Important:
        - This file **does not** execute any logic automatically.
        - The `main()` function must be explicitly invoked when needed.

    Dependencies:
        - dependencies (for handling package dependency management)

    Example:
        ```python
        from packages.requirements import main
        main()
        ```

FUNCTIONS
    main() -> None
        Entry point for the package installer. Sets up logging, processes command-line arguments,
        and installs or updates dependencies from a JSON requirements file.

        Args:
            None

        Returns:
            None: This function serves as the main entry point, performing actions based on
                  the command-line arguments, such as installing or updating dependencies.
