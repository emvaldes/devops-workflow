Help on module packages.requirements.__init__ in packages.requirements:

NAME
    packages.requirements.__init__ - File Path: packages/requirements/__init__.py

DESCRIPTION
    Description:
        This file initializes the `requirements` package, ensuring it is correctly recognized
        as a Python package. It provides an entry point for dependency management by exposing
        the `main` function from `dependencies.py`.

    Core Features:
        - **Package Initialization**:
          - Marks `requirements/` as a valid Python package.
          - Ensures explicit module control, preventing unintended imports.
        - **Dependency Management**:
          - Exposes `main()` from `dependencies.py` for managing package installations.
          - Facilitates structured and policy-driven dependency handling.

    Usage:
        Importing and executing dependency management:

            from packages.requirements import main
            main()

        Example execution:
            python -m packages.requirements

    Dependencies:
        - dependencies.py (Handles package dependency management)

    Expected Behavior:
        - The package remains passive until explicitly invoked.
        - Calling `main()` triggers the dependency installation process.
        - No automatic execution occurs upon import.

    Exit Codes:
        - 0: Execution completed successfully.
        - 1: Failure due to dependency issues, missing configurations, or package errors.

FUNCTIONS
    main() -> None
        Function: main() -> None
        Description:
            Entry point for the dependency management system.

        Parameters:
            - None

        Returns:
            - None: Executes dependency installation and policy enforcement.

        Behavior:
            - Reads and processes package requirements from `requirements.json`.
            - Installs, upgrades, or downgrades dependencies based on policies.
            - Logs package operations for debugging and compliance tracking.
