NAME
    packages.requirements.dependencies - File Path: ./packages/requirements/dependencies.py

DESCRIPTION
    Description:
        The dependencies.py module is the core of the AppFlow Tracer - Dependency Management System,
        providing structured and policy-driven package management. It integrates Homebrew (macOS)
        and Pip (cross-platform) to ensure compliance with package versioning,
        safe installations, and structured logging.

    Core Features:
        - Environment Detection: Determines Python installation method (Homebrew, system-managed, or standalone).
        - Package Management: Handles installation, upgrades, downgrades, and policy enforcement.
        - Brew & Pip Integration:
            - Uses Homebrew if Python is managed via Brew.
            - Uses Pip for all other installations with controlled system package handling.
        - Policy-Based Installation:
            - Installs missing dependencies.
            - Upgrades outdated packages if policy allows.
            - Downgrades packages if strict versioning is required.
        - Logging & Debugging:
            - Captures package operations, warnings, and errors.
            - Provides structured debugging messages.
        - Backup & Restore:
            - Saves the current package list for future restoration.
            - Supports migration of package environments.
        - Package Status Reporting:
            - Displays installed dependencies, versions, and compliance details.
            - Outputs structured reports to installed.json.

    Usage:
        Parsing Command-Line Arguments:
            from packages.requirements.dependencies import parse_arguments
            args = parse_arguments()

        Installing Dependencies:
            from packages.requirements.dependencies import main
            main()

    Dependencies:
        - sys - Manages system paths and process control.
        - subprocess - Runs Homebrew and Pip commands.
        - json - Handles structured storage of dependency data.
        - pathlib - Ensures safe file path handling.
        - functools - Optimizes frequently accessed functions with caching.
        - argparse - Parses command-line arguments.
        - platform - Detects system platform details.
        - importlib.metadata - Retrieves installed package versions.
        - brew_utils, package_utils, policy_utils, version_utils - Sub-modules managing dependency operations.

    Sub-Modules:
        - brew_utils.py: Detects Homebrew availability and retrieves package versions.
        - package_utils.py: Handles dependency installation using Brew or Pip.
        - policy_utils.py: Enforces policy-driven installation, upgrades, and downgrades.
        - version_utils.py: Fetches installed and latest package versions across multiple package managers.

    Expected Behavior:
        - Dynamically adapts package installation based on system constraints.
        - Installs, upgrades, or downgrades dependencies per predefined policies.
        - Logs all package operations for debugging.
        - Prevents unintended system modifications unless explicitly overridden (--force).

    Exit Codes:
        - 0: Execution completed successfully.
        - 1: Failure due to installation errors, missing configurations, or dependency issues.

FUNCTIONS
    main() -> None
        Function: main() -> None
        Description:
            Entry point for the dependency management system.

        Parameters:
            - None

        Returns:
            - None: Executes dependency installation and policy enforcement.

        Behavior:
            - Reads and processes package requirements from `requirements.json`.
            - Installs, upgrades, or downgrades dependencies based on policies.
            - Logs package operations for debugging and compliance tracking.

    parse_arguments() -> argparse.Namespace
        Function: parse_arguments() -> argparse.Namespace
        Description:
            Parses command-line arguments for package management, allowing users to define requirement files, enforce installations,
            backup, restore, or migrate packages.

        Returns:
            - argparse.Namespace: Parsed arguments object containing selected options.

        Behavior:
            - Supports JSON configuration for package management.
            - Allows forcing installations with --force.
            - Supports backup, restore, and migration of package environments.
            - Enables listing installed packages.

        Supported Arguments:
            - -c/--config: Specify a custom JSON requirements file.
            - -f/--force: Force Pip installations with --break-system-packages.
            - --backup-packages: Save installed packages for restoration.
            - --restore-packages: Restore package environment from a backup file.
            - --migrate-packages: Migrate legacy package environments.
            - --show-installed: Display installed dependencies.

        Error Handling:
            - Provides structured logging for missing configurations or invalid input.

DATA
    LIB_DIR = PosixPath('<project-location>/lib')
    Optional = typing.Optional
        Optional[X] is equivalent to Union[X, None].

    Union = typing.Union
        Union type; Union[X, Y] means either X or Y.

        On Python 3.10 and higher, the | operator
        can also be used to denote unions;
        X | Y means the same thing to the type checker as Union[X, Y].

        To define a union, use e.g. Union[int, str]. Details:
        - The arguments must be types and there must be at least one.
        - None as an argument is a special case and is replaced by
          type(None).
        - Unions of unions are flattened, e.g.::

            assert Union[Union[int, str], float] == Union[int, str, float]

        - Unions of a single argument vanish, e.g.::

            assert Union[int] == int  # The constructor actually returns int

        - Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.::

            assert Union[int, str, int] == Union[int, str]

        - When comparing unions, the argument order is ignored, e.g.::

            assert Union[int, str] == Union[str, int]

        - You cannot subclass or instantiate a union.
        - You can use Optional[X] as a shorthand for Union[X, None].
