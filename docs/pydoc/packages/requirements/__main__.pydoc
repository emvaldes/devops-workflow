NAME
    packages.requirements.__main__ - File Path: packages/requirements/__main__.py

DESCRIPTION
    Description:
        This file serves as the execution entry point for the `requirements` package when run
        in standalone mode. It initializes and runs the dependency management system by calling
        the `main()` function from `dependencies.py`.

    Core Features:
        - **Standalone Execution**:
          - Enables `python -m packages.requirements` execution.
          - Allows the package to be run independently without direct imports.
        - **Dependency Management**:
          - Calls `main()` from `dependencies.py` to handle package installations.
          - Applies structured package policies for controlled dependency enforcement.
        - **Modular Design**:
          - Supports both standalone execution and direct function imports.

    Usage:
        To execute the `requirements` package as a standalone script:

            python -m packages.requirements

        Example execution:

            python -m packages.requirements

    Dependencies:
        - dependencies.py (Handles package dependency management)

    Expected Behavior:
        - When run as a module, it triggers dependency management automatically.
        - Ensures dependencies are installed or updated based on predefined policies.
        - Logs all package operations for debugging and compliance tracking.

    Exit Codes:
        - 0: Execution completed successfully.
        - 1: Failure due to dependency issues, missing configurations, or package errors.
