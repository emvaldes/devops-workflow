DESCRIPTION
    Description:
        Requirements Package Entry Point

        This file serves as the execution entry point for the `requirements` package when run
        in standalone mode. It initializes and runs the dependency management system by calling
        the `main()` function from `dependencies.py`.

    Core Features:
        - **Standalone Execution**: Enables `python -m packages.requirements` execution.
        - **Dependency Management**: Calls `main()` from `dependencies.py` to handle dependencies.
        - **Modular Design**: Supports both standalone execution and direct function imports.

    Usage:
        To execute the `requirements` package as a standalone script:
        ```bash
        python -m packages.requirements
        ```

    Dependencies:
        - dependencies (for managing package dependencies)

    Example:
        ```bash
        python -m packages.requirements
        ```
