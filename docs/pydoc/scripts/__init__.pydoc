DESCRIPTION
    Description:
        Scripts Package Initialization

        This module ensures that the `scripts/` directory is recognized as a Python package.
        It provides a structured framework for organizing standalone scripts while maintaining
        explicit import control.

    Core Features:
        - **Package Initialization**: Enables `scripts/` to function as a Python package.
        - **Modular Script Management**: Ensures standalone scripts can be structured and executed efficiently.
        - **Explicit Import Control**: Prevents unintended execution by requiring explicit script imports.
        - **Future Expansion**: Can be extended to initialize common utilities if needed.

    Usage:
        Scripts within `scripts/` should be explicitly imported when needed:
            from scripts import some_script
            some_script.execute()

    Important Notes:
        - This file **does not** automatically import submodules to prevent unnecessary execution.
        - Individual scripts must be explicitly imported as required to maintain modularity.

    Dependencies:
        - None (This module is solely responsible for initialization)

    Example:
        To execute a standalone script within `scripts/`:
            from scripts import example_script
            example_script.run()
