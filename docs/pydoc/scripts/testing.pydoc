DESCRIPTION
    Description:
        Standalone Testing Script for Framework Logging

        This script serves as a test module to verify logging and tracing capabilities.
        It initializes structured logging via `packages.appflow_tracer.tracing`,
        prints configuration details, and runs a simple test output.

    Features:
        - Configures logging using `tracing.setup_logging()`.
        - Prints the loaded logging configuration in JSON format.
        - Serves as a standalone script that can be run independently.

    Expected Behavior:
        - The script prints the structured logging configuration.
        - Demonstrates logging setup and verification for debugging purposes.
        - Can be used as a simple test script for logging functionality.

    Dependencies:
        - `packages.appflow_tracer.tracing` (for structured logging)
        - `sys`, `json`, `logging`, `pathlib` (for system interaction and logging setup)

    Usage:
        To execute the test:
            python scripts/testing.py

    Exit Codes:
        - 0: Execution completed successfully.
        - 1: Failure due to logging setup errors or missing configurations.

FUNCTIONS
    main() -> None
        Function: main() -> None

        Description:
            Execute a standalone test to verify the structured logging system.

        Parameters:
            - None

        Returns:
            - None: Executes logging setup and test message output.

        Behavior:
            - Configures logging using `tracing.setup_logging()`.
            - Prints the loaded logging configuration in JSON format.
            - Displays a test output message.

        Raises:
            Exception: If an error occurs during logging setup.

        Example:
            >>> python scripts/testing.py
            CONFIGS: {
                "logging": { ... }
            }
            I am a stand-alone script minding my own business.
