DESCRIPTION
    Description:

    Standalone Testing Script for Framework Logging

    This script serves as a test module to verify logging and tracing capabilities.
    It initializes structured logging via `packages.appflow_tracer.tracing`,
    prints configuration details, and runs a simple test output.

    Features:

    - Configures logging using `tracing.setup_logging()`.
    - Prints the loaded logging configuration in JSON format.
    - Serves as a standalone script that can be run independently.

    Expected Behavior:

    - The script prints the structured logging configuration.
    - Demonstrates logging setup and verification for debugging purposes.
    - Can be used as a simple test script for logging functionality.

    Dependencies:

    - `packages.appflow_tracer.tracing` (for structured logging)
    - `sys`, `json`, `logging`, `pathlib` (for system interaction and logging setup)

    Usage:

    To execute the test:
    > python scripts/testing.py

FUNCTIONS
    main() -> None
        Execute a standalone test to verify the structured logging system.

        This function:
        - Configures logging using `tracing.setup_logging()`.
        - Prints the loaded logging configuration in JSON format.
        - Displays a test output message.

        Expected Behavior:
        - The script prints structured logging configuration details.
        - Demonstrates the integration of logging setup in a simple, standalone script.

        Raises:
            Exception: If an error occurs during logging setup.

        Returns:
            None

        Example:
            >>> python scripts/testing.py
            CONFIGS: {
                "logging": { ... }
            }
            I am a stand-alone script minding my own business.
