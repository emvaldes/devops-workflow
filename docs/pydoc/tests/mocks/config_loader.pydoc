NAME
    tests.mocks.config_loader - File Path: tests/mocks/config_loader.py

DESCRIPTION
    Description:
        Mock Configuration Loader Module

        This module provides utilities for loading mock JSON-based configurations used
        in testing environments. It dynamically loads and processes configuration files,
        ensuring structured fallback handling and maintaining data integrity.

    Core Features:
        - JSON Configuration Loading: Reads and validates structured JSON files.
        - Base Configuration Handling: Ensures required fields exist in loaded configurations.
        - Mock Data Processing: Allows simulated testing of dependency behaviors.
        - Error Handling: Captures and logs missing or malformed JSON files.

    Usage:
        To load mock requirements:
            from tests.mocks.config_loader import load_mock_requirements
            mock_config = load_mock_requirements()

        To load installed package mock data:
            from tests.mocks.config_loader import load_mock_installed
            installed_config = load_mock_installed()

    Dependencies:
        - sys - Handles system path modifications.
        - os - Provides file system utilities.
        - json - Loads and validates JSON-based configuration data.
        - pathlib - Ensures safe file path resolution.

    Global Behavior:
        - Loads mock configuration data dynamically.
        - Ensures missing configuration fields are populated with default values.
        - Prevents errors due to missing or malformed configuration files.

    Exit Codes:
        - 0: Execution completed successfully.
        - 1: Failure due to configuration loading errors.

FUNCTIONS
    load_mock_installed() -> dict
        Function: load_mock_installed() -> dict

        Description:
            Loads and returns the contents of `mock_installed.json`, ensuring missing fields are populated.

        Parameters:
            - None

        Returns:
            - dict: The processed installed package configuration dictionary.

        Behavior:
            - Ensures structured test data for installed dependencies.
            - Uses `BASE_INSTALLED_CONFIG` as a fallback if the file is missing.

    load_mock_requirements() -> dict
        Function: load_mock_requirements() -> dict

        Description:
            Loads and returns the contents of `mock_requirements.json`, ensuring missing fields are populated.

        Parameters:
            - None

        Returns:
            - dict: The processed configuration dictionary with all necessary fields.

        Behavior:
            - Ensures a structured mock environment for package requirements.
            - Uses `BASE_REQUIREMENTS_CONFIG` as a fallback if the file is missing.

    main() -> None
        Function: main() -> None

        Description:
            Placeholder function for module execution.

        Parameters:
            - None

        Returns:
            - None
