NAME
    tests.appflow_tracer.tracing.test_tracing - # File: ./tests/appflow_tracer/tracing/test_tracing_utils.py

FUNCTIONS
    mock_configs()
        Mock the `CONFIGS` object globally for all tests if not already initialized.

        This fixture ensures that the `CONFIGS` object is available globally for all tests. If `CONFIGS` is not
        initialized, it creates a default configuration with logging and tracing disabled, and events for `install`
        and `update` enabled. It provides a consistent configuration for all tests that require access to `CONFIGS`.

        The fixture is automatically applied to all tests because of the `autouse=True` flag, eliminating the need to
        explicitly request it in individual test functions.

        Returns:
            dict: The `CONFIGS` dictionary, which includes configuration for logging, tracing, and event handling.

    mock_logger() -> unittest.mock.MagicMock
        Create a mock logger for testing purposes.

        This fixture creates and returns a mock instance of a logger object using `MagicMock`, which simulates the behavior
        of a `logging.Logger` object. It also ensures that the `handlers` attribute is properly initialized as an empty list.

        This fixture is useful for testing logging functionality without writing actual logs, enabling verification of logging behavior
        and ensuring that logging methods are called as expected.

        Returns:
            MagicMock: A mock logger object that mimics the behavior of a `logging.Logger` instance.

    test_ansi_file_handler(mock_logger: unittest.mock.MagicMock) -> None
        Ensure `tracing.ANSIFileHandler` removes ANSI sequences before writing logs.

        This test:
        - Verifies that `ANSIFileHandler` strips ANSI escape codes from log messages before writing them to a file.
        - Uses a helper function to remove ANSI codes and ensures that the final message written to the file does not contain any escape codes.

        Args:
            mock_logger (MagicMock): Mock logger used to verify the behavior of the file handler.

        Returns:
            None: This test does not return a value but asserts that ANSI escape codes are correctly stripped before logging to a file.

    test_print_capture(mock_logger: unittest.mock.MagicMock) -> None
        Ensure `tracing.PrintCapture` properly captures and logs print statements.

        This test ensures:
        - The `PrintCapture` handler captures print statements directed to `sys.stdout`.
        - Validates that the captured output is logged as expected.

        Args:
            mock_logger (MagicMock): Mock logger used to verify the captured logs.

        Returns:
            None: This test does not return a value but asserts that the print statements are captured and logged correctly.

    test_setup_logging(mock_logger: unittest.mock.MagicMock) -> None
        Ensure `tracing.setup_logging()` correctly initializes logging configurations.

        This test verifies:
        - The returned `CONFIGS` contains all expected keys: `colors`, `logging`, `tracing`, and `stats`.
        - The logging file path is correctly assigned, with a dynamic filename containing the timestamp.
        - Ensures that `stats.created` remains static while `stats.updated` changes per execution.

        Args:
            mock_logger (MagicMock): Mock for the logger object to simulate logging behavior.

        Returns:
            None: This test does not return a value but asserts that logging configurations are set up correctly.
