NAME
    tests.requirements.dependencies.package_utils.test_package_utils - # File: ./tests/requirements/dependencies/package_utils/test_package_utils.py

FUNCTIONS
    mock_config()
        Create a mock CONFIGS dictionary with required settings for testing.

    test_backup_packages()
        Validate that `backup_packages()` correctly saves the list of installed packages.

        - **Purpose**: Verify that the function correctly generates a package backup.
        - **Mocked Components**:
            - `subprocess.run()` (to simulate `pip freeze`).
            - `open()` (to avoid writing to an actual file).
        - **Expected Behavior**:
            - Ensures `pip freeze` runs correctly.
            - Writes package output to a file.

        **Test Strategy:**
            - Mocks `subprocess.run` to simulate `pip freeze` output.
            - Mocks `open()` to avoid writing to an actual file.
            - Ensures that `pip freeze` output is redirected to the backup file.
            - Verifies that logging captures success.

        Expected Output:
            - The correct `pip freeze` command executes.
            - The file write operation is mocked successfully.
            - A success log entry is created.

    test_install_package_brew()
        Ensure `install_package()` correctly installs a package using Homebrew if available.

        - **Purpose**: Validate that Brew is used for package installation when available.
        - **Mocked Components**:
            - `subprocess.run()` (to mock Brew installation).
        - **Expected Behavior**:
            - Ensures `brew install` is called when applicable.

        **Test Strategy:**
            - Mocks `subprocess.run` to simulate a Homebrew installation.
            - Mocks `brew_utils.check_availability()` to return `True`.

        **Expected Behavior:**
            - `brew install` is executed instead of Pip.

    test_install_package_pip()
        Ensure `install_package()` correctly installs a package using Pip.

        - **Purpose**: Validate that Pip is used for installation when Homebrew is not available.
        - **Mocked Components**:
            - `subprocess.run()` (to mock Pip installation).
        - **Expected Behavior**:
            - Ensures `pip install` is called.

        **Test Strategy:**
            - Mocks `subprocess.run` to simulate a successful Pip installation.
            - Ensures Pip is selected when Homebrew is not managing Python.

        Expected Output:
            - `pip install` is executed with the correct package name.

    test_install_requirements(mock_config)
        Ensure `install_requirements()` correctly installs dependencies based on policy.

        - **Purpose**: Validate that dependency installations follow policy constraints.
        - **Mocked Components**:
            - `install_package()` (to prevent real installations).
        - **Expected Behavior**:
            - Ensures `install_package()` is called only for missing or outdated packages.

        **Test Strategy:**
            - Uses a mock version of `requirements.json` and `installed.json`.
            - Mocks `install_package()` to verify correct calls.
            - Ensures `policy_utils.policy_management()` is applied before installation.

        **Expected Behavior:**
            - `install_package()` is called for required dependencies.
            - Packages already at the correct version are skipped.

    test_install_requirements_adhoc(mock_config)
        Ensure `install_requirements()` correctly bypasses policy checks when `status="adhoc"`.

        - **Purpose**: Validate that setting `status="adhoc"` forces installation.
        - **Mocked Components**:
            - `install_package()` (to prevent real installations).
            - `log_message()` (to verify that `[AD-HOC]` logs appear).
        - **Expected Behavior**:
            - Ensures all packages are installed when `status="adhoc"`.
            - Confirms `[AD-HOC]` log message appears.

        **Test Strategy:**
            - Directly modify the mock `CONFIGS["requirements"]` to set `status="adhoc"`.
            - Mocks `install_package()` to verify calls.
            - Ensures `[AD-HOC]` log message appears in output.
            - Ensures all packages are installed even if they don't need an upgrade.

        **Expected Behavior:**
            - `install_package()` is called for **all** dependencies.
            - `[AD-HOC]` log message appears in log output.

    test_restore_packages()
        Ensure `restore_packages()` correctly reinstalls packages from a backup file.

        - **Purpose**: Validate package restoration from a backup.
        - **Mocked Components**:
            - `subprocess.run()` (to mock `pip install -r`).
        - **Expected Behavior**:
            - Ensures `pip install -r` is called.

        **Test Strategy:**
            - Mocks `subprocess.run` to simulate `pip install -r <file>`.
            - Ensures the function logs a success message.

        Expected Output:
            - `pip install -r` is executed with the correct backup file.

    test_review_packages()
        Ensure `review_packages()` correctly evaluates installed package versions.

        - **Purpose**: Validate package compliance enforcement.
        - **Mocked Components**:
            - `version_utils.installed_version()` (to simulate different installed versions).
            - `installed_configfile()` (to return a valid installed.json path).
        - **Expected Behavior**:
            - Correctly determines package statuses (`latest`, `upgraded`, `outdated`, `missing`).
            - Ensures `installed.json` is correctly updated.

        **Test Strategy:**
            - Mocks `version_utils.installed_version()` to return various package versions.
            - Mocks `installed_configfile()` to return a valid file path.
            - Ensures that package statuses are correctly evaluated and written in a structured format.

        **Expected Behavior:**
            - Returns a list of dependencies with correct status assignments.
            - Writes a properly formatted `installed.json`.
