NAME
    tests.requirements.dependencies.test_dependencies - # File: ./tests/test_dependencies.py

FUNCTIONS
    mock_configs()
        Mock `CONFIGS` globally for all tests if it has not been initialized.

        This fixture ensures that the `CONFIGS` object is available globally for all tests. If `CONFIGS` has not been
        previously initialized, it will set it to a default configuration with logging and tracing disabled, and
        events for `install` and `update` enabled. This provides a consistent set of configuration values for all
        tests that require `CONFIGS`.

        This fixture is automatically used for all tests due to the `autouse=True` flag, so it doesn't need to be explicitly
        requested in each test.

        Returns:
            dict: The `CONFIGS` dictionary containing configuration values for logging, tracing, and events.

    test_debug_installation(mock_get_version, package, expected_version)
        Debugging test to check whether the package installation check
        is returning expected results.

        This test verifies:
        - That `get_installed_version` returns the correct version for a given package.
        - It prints debugging information to show the expected and actual versions.

        Args:
            mock_get_version (MagicMock): Mock version of `get_installed_version` to simulate package version checking.
            package (str): The name of the package to check.
            expected_version (str or None): The expected version of the package.

        Returns:
            None: This test does not return any value. It asserts that the package version returned matches the expected version.

    test_install_requirements(
        mock_get_version,
        mock_install,
        tmp_path,
        mock_configs
    )
        Test that `dependencies.install_requirements` correctly skips installation if
        the required version is already installed, and triggers installation
        when the package is missing.

        This test verifies:
        - The correct version is retrieved from `requirements.json`.
        - That the installation is skipped if the correct version is already installed.
        - That installation is triggered if the package is missing.

    test_is_package_installed(mock_version, mock_subproc_call, mock_configs)
        Test that `dependencies.is_package_installed` correctly checks if a package is installed.

        This test ensures:
        - That the function correctly returns `True` if the package is installed with the expected version.
        - That the function returns `False` if the package is not installed or if the version does not match.

        Args:
            mock_version (MagicMock): Mock version of `importlib.metadata.version` to simulate the installed version of the package.
            mock_subproc_call (MagicMock): Mock subprocess call to prevent actual installations.
            mock_configs (dict): Mock configuration used for the installation check.

        Returns:
            None: This test does not return any value but asserts that the function returns the expected boolean result.

    test_load_requirements_invalid_json(tmp_path, mock_configs)
        Test that loading a malformed JSON file raises a ValueError.

        This test ensures that:
        - A `ValueError` is raised when the requirements file contains invalid JSON.

        Args:
            tmp_path (Path): Temporary directory provided by pytest for creating test files.
            mock_configs (dict): Mock configuration used for loading the requirements file.

        Returns:
            None: This test does not return any value but raises an exception if the JSON is invalid.

    test_load_requirements_missing(mock_configs)
        Test that loading a missing requirements file raises a FileNotFoundError.

        This test ensures that:
        - A `FileNotFoundError` is raised when the requirements file does not exist.

        Args:
            mock_configs (dict): Mock configuration used for loading the requirements file.

        Returns:
            None: This test does not return any value but raises an exception if the file is not found.

    test_load_requirements_valid(tmp_path, mock_configs)
        Test that a valid requirements file is correctly loaded.

        This test verifies:
        - That a valid JSON file containing package information is loaded correctly.

        Args:
            tmp_path (Path): Temporary directory provided by pytest for creating test files.
            mock_configs (dict): Mock configuration used for loading the requirements file.

        Returns:
            None: This test does not return any value but asserts that the loaded data matches the expected format.

    test_package_management(
        mock_subproc,
        mock_brew_available,
        mock_version,
        mock_configs,
        tmp_path
    )
        Test that `dependencies.package_management` does not attempt installation
        if the package is already installed with the correct version, dynamically fetched from `requirements.json`.

        This test ensures:
        - The correct version is retrieved from `requirements.json`.
        - If the package is already installed with the correct version, no installation is attempted.

        Args:
            mock_subproc (MagicMock): Mock version of `subprocess.run` to prevent actual system calls.
            mock_brew_available (MagicMock): Mock version of `is_brew_available` to always return True.

            mock_configs (dict): Mock configuration used for the installation process.
            tmp_path (Path): Temporary directory provided by pytest for creating test files.

        Returns:
            None: This test does not return any value but asserts that the installation is not triggered if the version matches.

    test_parse_arguments_custom()
        Test that the custom requirements file argument is correctly parsed.

        This test verifies:
        - That when a custom file path is provided via command line arguments, it is correctly parsed by `parse_arguments()`.

        Returns:
            None: This test does not return any value but asserts that the custom requirements file path is correctly recognized.

    test_parse_arguments_default()
        Test that the default requirements file path is used when no custom argument is provided.

        This test verifies:
        - That when no custom file path is provided via command line arguments, the default path is used.

        Returns:
            None: This test does not return any value but asserts that the default requirements file path is used when necessary.

    test_print_installed_packages(mock_log_message, tmp_path, mock_configs)
