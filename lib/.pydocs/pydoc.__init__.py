Overview:
    The __init__.py file is responsible for marking the 'lib' directory as a Python package,
    allowing its modules to be imported properly within the project.

    This file serves as the entry point for the 'lib' package and may include shared imports,
    initialization logic, or package-wide configuration settings.

Core Features:
    - Package Initialization: Ensures 'lib' is recognized as a Python package.
    - Shared Module Accessibility: Provides a central location for utility imports.
    - Extensibility: Can be modified to include package-wide configurations if necessary.

Expected Behavior & Usage:
    Importing Modules from 'lib':
        from lib import system_variables, file_utils

Example Integration:
    from lib import log_utils
        log_utils.log_message("Initialization successful.")

Important Notes:
    - This file does not automatically import all submodules to prevent unnecessary overhead.
    - Individual submodules must be explicitly imported when required.
