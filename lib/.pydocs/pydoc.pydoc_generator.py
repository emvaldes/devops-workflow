Description:
    The pydoc_generator.py module automates the generation of structured documentation for Python modules
    by leveraging Python's built-in pydoc utility. It also integrates test coverage analysis and logging.

Core Features:
    - **Automatic Documentation Generation**: Uses pydoc to generate structured `.pydoc` files.
    - **Test Coverage Reporting**: Integrates with `coverage.py` to produce detailed reports.
    - **Dynamic File Structure Creation**: Ensures documentation files are stored systematically.
    - **Error Handling and Logging**: Provides structured logs for troubleshooting and debugging.
    - **Path Normalization**: Handles absolute and relative paths across various environments.

Usage:
    Creating a PyDoc Structure:
        from lib.pydoc_generator import create_structure
        doc_dir = create_structure(Path("/docs"), "my_package")

    Generating Documentation for a Module:
        from lib.pydoc_generator import generate_pydoc
        generate_pydoc(Path("/project"), Path("/project/lib/my_module.py"), Path("/docs"))

Dependencies:
    - sys - Handles system path modifications and process exits.
    - os - Provides file system utilities.
    - re - Regular expressions for text sanitization.
    - subprocess - Executes external commands (`pydoc`, `coverage`).
    - pathlib - Ensures safe and platform-independent file path resolution.
    - coverage - Generates code coverage reports.

Global Behavior:
    - Generates documentation for Python modules.
    - Captures and logs errors encountered during the process.
    - Normalizes paths for consistent file system operations.
    - Applies automated test coverage validation.

CLI Integration:
    This module primarily runs as part of an automated documentation pipeline but can be executed manually.

Example Execution:
    python pydoc_generator.py

Expected Behavior:
    - Successfully generates `.pydoc` documentation files.
    - Produces test coverage reports if coverage data is available.
    - Handles missing documentation files gracefully.
    - Logs all key actions and errors.

Exit Codes:
    - 0: Execution completed successfully.
    - 1: Error encountered during documentation generation.
