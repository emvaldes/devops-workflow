Description:
    The pkgconfig_loader.py module provides utilities for dynamically loading, validating, and managing
    package configurations. It ensures structured configuration handling, logging setup, and package-specific
    settings retrieval.

Core Features:
    - JSON Configuration Loading: Reads and validates structured configuration files.
    - Dynamic Logging Setup: Generates unique log file names and directories.
    - Configuration Overrides: Allows runtime overrides of configuration parameters.
    - Automatic Configuration Updates: Ensures settings are refreshed dynamically.
    - Error Handling: Captures and logs errors for missing or malformed configuration files.

Usage:
    Loading Package Configurations:
        from lib.pkgconfig_loader import package_configs
        config = package_configs()

    Setting Up Configurations:
        from lib.pkgconfig_loader import setup_configs
        config = setup_configs(Path("/path/to/module"))

Dependencies:
    - sys - Handles system path modifications and process exits.
    - os - Provides file system utilities.
    - json - Loads, modifies, and validates configuration data.
    - datetime - Handles timestamps for logging and configuration updates.
    - pathlib - Ensures safe file path resolution.
    - typing (Optional, Union) - Defines flexible function return types.

Global Behavior:
    - Loads package configurations dynamically.
    - Generates structured logging paths.
    - Handles missing or invalid configuration files gracefully.
    - Updates timestamps when configurations change.

CLI Integration:
    This module primarily supports configuration loading for other scripts but can be executed for testing.

Example Execution:
    python pkgconfig_loader.py

Expected Behavior:
    - Reads JSON-based configuration files.
    - Ensures logging directories and filenames are structured.
    - Handles missing configuration files with default fallbacks.

Exit Codes:
    - 0: Execution completed successfully.
    - 1: Error encountered in configuration processing.

    Function: config_logfile(config: dict, caller_log_path: Optional[str] = None) -> Path
    Description:
        Generates a structured log file path based on package settings.

    Parameters:
        - config (dict): Configuration dictionary containing logging details.
        - caller_log_path (Optional[str]): Custom log file path if specified.

    Returns:
        - Path: The computed log file path.

    Behavior:
        - Uses package name and timestamp to generate a unique log filename.
        - If a caller_log_path is provided, the log file is placed there.
        - Otherwise, the logs directory from the configuration is used.

    "package_configs": """
    Function: package_configs(overrides: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict
    Description:
        Loads and returns package configuration settings, applying overrides if provided.

    Parameters:
        - overrides (Optional[dict]): Dictionary of settings to override.

    Returns:
        - dict: The structured configuration dictionary.

    Behavior:
        - Attempts to load a package-specific JSON configuration file.
        - If no file exists, generates a default configuration.
        - Merges any overrides provided by the caller.
        - Generates a log filename and updates timestamps dynamically.

    Error Handling:
        - Logs and exits if the JSON file is missing or malformed.

    Function: setup_configs(absolute_path: Path, logname_override: Optional[str] = None, events: Optional[Union[bool, list, dict]] = None) -> dict
    Description:
        Initializes and updates configuration settings based on the callerâ€™s package details.

    Parameters:
        - absolute_path (Path): Path to the module requiring configuration.
        - logname_override (Optional[str]): Allows overriding the default log filename.
        - events (Optional[Union[bool, list, dict]]): Specifies which logging events should be enabled.

    Returns:
        - dict: The final configuration dictionary.

    Behavior:
        - Identifies the calling module and determines package name.
        - Loads or generates the expected configuration file.
        - Adjusts logging settings, including log directory and filename.
        - Updates the configuration file dynamically with new settings.

    Error Handling:
        - Logs and exits if configuration updates fail.
