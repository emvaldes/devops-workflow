Description:
    This module contains unit tests for `dependencies.py`, ensuring proper functionality of
    command-line argument parsing, dependency management workflows, and structured execution
    of package operations (backup, restore, migration, and installation).

Core Features:
    - **Command-Line Argument Parsing**: Ensures argument handling for dependency configurations.
    - **Mock-Based Testing**: Simulates dependencies to validate package management behaviors.
    - **Backup, Restore, and Migration Workflows**: Verifies correct execution logic.
    - **Logging Validation**: Ensures structured log messages are generated as expected.
    - **Dynamic Dependency Policy Enforcement**: Validates policy-based package management.

Mocking Strategy:
    - `policy_utils.policy_management()` → Simulates policy enforcement logic.
    - `package_utils.install_requirements()` → Mocks package installation logic.
    - `package_utils.backup_packages()` → Ensures backup functionality executes correctly.
    - `package_utils.restore_packages()` → Ensures restore functionality executes correctly.
    - `package_utils.migrate_packages()` → Validates migration workflow.
    - `log_utils.log_message()` → Verifies structured logging messages.

Usage:
    Execute PyTest to run the test cases:
        pytest tests/requirements/dependencies/test_dependencies_utils.py

Important Notes:
    - This test module ensures no external API calls are made.
    - Dependency enforcement logic is controlled through mock-based validation.
    - All file-based operations are simulated and do not modify actual configurations.

Dependencies:
    - pytest (for unit testing framework)
    - argparse (for command-line argument handling)
    - json (for serialization in testing scenarios)
    - pathlib (for file path management)
    - unittest.mock (for function patching and test isolation)

Example:
    ```python
    pytest tests/requirements/dependencies/test_dependencies_utils.py
    ```

    Convert `PosixPath` objects to strings for JSON serialization.

    Validate the behavior of `parse_arguments()` function.

    **Test Strategy:**
        - Mocks `sys.argv` to simulate command-line arguments.
        - Ensures correct default values and argument overrides.
        - Prevents `argparse` from exiting unexpectedly.

    **Expected Behavior:**
        - Default configuration file is `requirements.json`.
        - If `-c <file>` is provided, it overrides the default value.

    Validate the execution of the `main()` function.

    **Test Strategy:**
        - Mocks dependency policies, package installation, and logging.
        - Ensures proper execution of package management workflows.
        - Simulates backup and restore operations.

    **Expected Behavior:**
        - Policy enforcement function is called before installation.
        - Backup and restore commands trigger appropriate function calls.
        - Log messages are generated for major execution steps.

    "test_main_restore": """
    Validate restore functionality within the `main()` function.

    **Test Strategy:**
        - Mocks the `--restore-packages` command-line argument.
        - Ensures `restore_packages()` function is correctly executed.
        - Validates structured logging behavior.

    **Expected Behavior:**
        - Restore operation is triggered.
        - No package installation occurs if only `--restore-packages` is provided.
