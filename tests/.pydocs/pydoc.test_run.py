Description:
    PyTest Module for Validating Execution of run.py

    This module ensures that run.py correctly handles:
    - Command-line argument parsing.
    - File collection for Python scripts.
    - Execution of pydoc and coverage reporting.
    - Structured logging of execution steps.

Test Coverage:
    1. Argument Parsing (parse_arguments)
       - Ensures correct CLI flag interpretation.
       - Confirms SystemExit is raised for --help.

    2. File Collection (collect_files)
       - Verifies Python files are properly discovered.

    3. Execution & Coverage (main)
       - Validates handling of --pydoc and --coverage flags.
       - Mocks subprocesses and file interactions.

Mocking Strategy:
    - subprocess.run() → Prevents actual system calls.
    - log_utils.log_message() → Ensures structured logging messages.
    - collect_files() → Controls file collection behavior.

Expected Behavior:
    - run.py correctly processes command-line arguments.
    - Backup, restore, and migration options execute correctly.
    - Logging captures all major execution steps.

Exit Codes:
    - 0: Execution completed successfully.
    - 1: Failure due to invalid arguments or execution errors.
